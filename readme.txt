A simple WordPress plugin that creates a shortcode to loop through posts, pages, or custom post types and display them anywhere on your site.

== Description ==

Easily display posts, pages, or custom post types in content areas using a customizable shortcode. Display your latest posts, group by taxonomies, or use custom templates with Timber for Twig support.

== Installation ==

1. Install via WordPress Add New Plugin feature by searching "AC Custom Loop," or upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/ac-wp-custom-loop`.
2. Activate the plugin via the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.
3. Use `[ac_custom_loop]` shortcode in any page, post, or widget supporting shortcodes.
4. The default setup displays your latest 4 posts. Customize with attributes like `type` and `show`, e.g., `[ac_custom_loop type="page" show="3"]` to display the latest three pages.

== Shortcode Options and Examples ==

**Display a specific post type:**
`[ac_custom_loop type="foo"]`
This displays posts from the `foo` custom post type.

**Display posts with specific tags:**
`[ac_custom_loop type="post" tax="tag" term="foo"]`
This displays posts tagged with `foo`.

**Group posts by taxonomy (e.g., categories and tags):**
`[ac_custom_loop type="post" subtax="category,tag"]`
Groups posts by categories, then by tags within each category.

**Exclude posts by specific tags:**
`[ac_custom_loop type="post" tax="tag" term="foo,bar" exclude="baz"]`
This displays posts tagged with `foo` and `bar`, but excludes those tagged with `baz`.

**Use a custom template for loop display:**
To use a custom template, copy `loop-template.php` from the plugin folder to the root of your theme folder and modify as desired. You can also create templates for specific post types (e.g., `loop-template-post.php`).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I show posts from a specific post type? =
Use `[ac_custom_loop type="your_post_type"]` to show posts from a specific custom post type.

= Can I display posts with a specific taxonomy term? =
Yes! Use `[ac_custom_loop type="post" tax="tag" term="your_term"]` to filter posts by taxonomy term.

= How can I group posts by taxonomies? =
Use `[ac_custom_loop subtax="category,tag"]` to group posts by taxonomies.
